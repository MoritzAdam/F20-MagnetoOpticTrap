# F20-MagnetoOpticTrap
This code set was created by Jonathan Stelter and Moritz Adam for evaluation of  the Magneto-Optic-Trap
experiment (F20) of the advanced physics lab courses at the Institute for Phyiscs
(Physikalisches Institut) at Heidelberg University.
A documentation of the experiment can be found on the web pages of the [advanced physics lab](https://www.physi.uni-heidelberg.de/Einrichtungen/FP/anleitungen/F20.pdf). 
The code set can be used for plotting, fitting and analyzing spectroscopy data 
of Rubidium obtained through Saturated Laser Absorption Spectroscopy and both loading 
and release/recapture measurements at an Magneto-Optic Trap (MOT). For the MOT-part 
an enhanced version of Renato Ferracini Alves' [code](https://github.com/RFerraciniAlves/FP-20-notebooks) was used.
